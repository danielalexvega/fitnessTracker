# fitnessTracker
This app tracks your daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. 

## Using the app

When a user opens the app, the most recent workout is displayed. The user can then continue that work out or create a new one. 

### Continuing a workout

When the user continues a workout, they can add more exercises to their workout. A real world example would be if you go to a gym, you might do multiple workouts to target different muscle groups. (Bench press, pull-downs, squats, etc.)

### Create a new workout

When the user creates a new workout, they select an exercise type, either resistance or cardio.
